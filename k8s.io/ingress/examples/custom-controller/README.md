# Dummy controller

This example contains the source code of a simple dummy controller. If you want
more details on the interface, or what the generic controller is actually doing,
please read [this doc](/docs/dev/devel.md). You can deploy the controller as
follows:

```console
$ kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
service "default-backend" created
deployment "dummy-ingress-controller" created

$ kubectl get po
NAME                                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dummy-ingress-controller-3685541482-082nl   1/1       Running   0          10m
