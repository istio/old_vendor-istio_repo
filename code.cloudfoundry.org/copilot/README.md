# Copilot

To help Pilot work with Cloud Foundry

To get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/copilot.git
cd copilot
go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
go get github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
dep ensure
```

To run the tests:

```sh
ginkgo -r -p -race
```

To compile the server:

```sh
go build code.cloudfoundry.org/copilot/cmd/copilot-server
```

## Using the Server

We are using a generic grpc client to interact with cloud controller grpc service (installation instructions below)

### Setup GRPC Client

If you are developing locally, you can install `grpcurl`
```sh
go get -u github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl
```

If you are using a cloudfoundry
- bosh ssh to the istio-control vm and `sudo su`
- grpcurl is at `/var/vcap/packages/grpcurl/bin/grpcurl`
- the certs you need are in `/var/vcap/jobs/pilot-discovery/config/certs/`


### Push an App

```sh
cf push ...
```

### Find Diego Process GUID
##### Get the CAPI Process GUID:
The following example assumes the "web" process type, but you can replace that with another type if you know what you're doing.

```sh
export CAPI_PROCESS_GUID=$(cf curl "/v3/apps/$(cf curl "/v3/apps" | jq -r '.resources[] | select(.name == "<app-name>") | .guid')/processes" | jq -r '.resources[] | select(.type == "web") | .guid')
```

##### Get the CAPI Process Version:
The CAPI Process GUID is not sufficient for routing. If you want to map/delete a route, you'll need the entire `<capi-process-guid>-<version>` concatenation (the "Diego Process GUID"):

```sh
export APP_GUID=$(cf app <my-app> --guid) # to obtain the application guid
export CAPI_PROCESS_VERSION=$(cf curl /v2/apps/$APP_GUID | jq -r .entity.version) # to obtain the version
```

##### Construct the Diego Process GUID
```sh
export DIEGO_PROCESS_GUID="$CAPI_PROCESS_GUID-$CAPI_PROCESS_VERSION"
```

##### Get the Route Guid used by Cloud Controller
Given an existing route in cloud controller...

```sh
export CAPI_ROUTE_GUID=$(cf curl /v2/routes | jq -r '.resources[] | select(.entity.host == "<hostname-of-existing-route>").metadata.guid')
```

### As Cloud Controller, Add a Route

/var/vcap/packages/grpcurl/bin/grpcurl -cacert ./ca.crt \
  -key ./client.key \
  -cert ./client.crt \
  -d '{"capi_process_guid": "capi_guid_1"}' \
  copilot.service.cf.internal:9001 \
  api.CloudControllerCopilot/DeleteCapiDiegoProcessAssociation
```

### As Cloud Controller, Unmap a Route

### As Cloud Controller, Delete a Route

### View pilot API results
```sh
curl localhost:8080/v1/routes/[LISTENER PORT NUMBER: 80/443]/x/router~x~x~x
```

and

```sh
curl localhost:8080/v1/clusters/x/router~x~x~x
```

and

```sh
curl localhost:8080/v1/registration
```

or

```sh
curl localhost:8080/v1/registration/some.hostname.you.choose
```

you can scale your app up

```sh
cf scale -i 3 your-app
```

and then re-run the above `curl` commands.

## Debugging

To open an ssh against a copilot running in a cloud foundry:

- `ssh -f -L 9000:$COPILOT_IP:9000 jumpbox@$(bbl jumpbox-address) -i $JUMPBOX_PRIVATE_KEY sleep 600` this will open a tunnel for 10 minutes
- make sure that `copilot.listen_address` is `0.0.0.0:9000` and not `127.0.0.1:9000`
- open a hole in the jumpbox firewall rule (envname-jumpbox-to-all) to allow traffic on port 9000

Now you are ready to start your own pilot:

- `bosh scp -r istio:/var/vcap/jobs/pilot-discovery/config /tmp/config`
- check that the `/tmp/config/cf_config.yml` so the IP address matches your tunnel and the cert file paths point to /tmp/config
- install dlv on your machine `go get -u github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv`
- from istio: `dlv debug ./pilot/cmd/pilot-discovery/main.go -- discovery --configDir=/dev/null --registries=CloudFoundry --cfConfig=/users/pivotal/downloads/config/cf_config.yml --meshConfig=/dev/null`
